big Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each big release.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

- Enabled data section compression by default for both BigWIG and BigBED.
- Extended the API to allow non-standard byte order to be used when
  creating BigWIG and BigBED files.
- Changed 'Big*.write' to pre-compute zoom levels. The current implementation
  is far from being optimal, but it is, however, easy to comprehend.
- Implemented summarisation for BigWIG files.
- Changed 'BigWigFile.write' to splice WIG sections larger than
  'Short.MAX_VALUE'.
- Fixed 'BigWigFile#query' which sometimes returned values outside
  of a given query interval.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 6th 2015

- Changed 'RTreeIndex' not to enforce the leaves to only contain items
  from a single chromosome.
- Fixed 'RTreeIndex.write' for the case of a few items to be indexed.
- Fixed 'FixedStepSection#query' for the case of overlapping intervals.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Released on July 29th 2015

- Added basic support for summarising BigBED data. The implementation
  is only capable of using pre-computed zoom levels, i.e. 'BigBedFile.write'
  does not build zoomed indices.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on July 24th 2015
