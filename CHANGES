big Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each big release.

Version 0.4.0
-------------
- Fixed IllegalStateException: impossible "browser" section type in *.wig file,
 see issue #30 on GitHub

- Fixed IllegalArgumentException in BedEntry.<init>, see issue #29 on GitHub.
 Big bed serialization fixed.

- Support big files larger than 2G (issue #28) using com.indeed:util-mmap   Memory mapping library

- Switch to Kotlin 1.1.x

- Concurrent access to big bed/wig files improved. BigFile.duplicate() call
 not required any more for concurrent access. Method marked as obsolete.

Version 0.3.6
-------------
- Added 'RomBuffer' caching for internal querying: Now if
  'BigWig.summarizeInternal' of nearby regions are called one by one,
  'RTreeIndexLeaf' which contains these regions wouldn't be
  decompressed multiple times, it will be taken from cache.

- Added loop stop after section match in 'BigWig.queryInternal': It's
  not necessary to go through all 'RTreeIndexLeaf' regions if we
  already found ones which are needed.

Version 0.3.5
-------------
- Fixed summary semantics: Now for each intersected interval summary 'sum' value is increased in
 "intersected nucleotides number" x "interval value" instead of "intersection %" x "interval value".

 Idea is that interval summary = "nucleotide number" * "interval value" thus intersected sum should be increased in
 "intersection %" x "interval summary" = "intersected nucleotides number" x "interval value".
  Old semantics was incorrect, difference was visible at 1-bp resolution.

- More informative error message if actual magic doesn't match expected guess

Version 0.3.4
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 28th 2016

- Added a fast-path to 'VariableStepSection.set'.
- Sped up 'WigFile' and reduced allocation rate.
- Fixed unbounded looping in 'BigWigFile.write' and 'BigBedFile.write'
  in case the data contains items with unknown chromosomes.
- Changed 'WigSection.size' to be a property.

Version 0.3.3
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 14th 2016

- Fixed 'BigWigFile.write' and 'BigBedFile.write' in case the data
  contains items with unknown chromosomes.

Version 0.3.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 6th, 2016

- Renamed 'WigParser' to 'WigFile' which is initialized with a file to
  prevent possible use-after-exhausted bugs.
- Allowed gzipped and zipped input in 'WigFile' and 'BedFile'.

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 5th, 2016

- Fixed 'BigWigFile.write' in the case of no-data chromosomes.
- Fixed offset tracking in 'BigWigSummary' and 'BigBedSummary' which
  did not support multiple chromosomes.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on February 17th, 2016

- Switched to mmapped files for reading 'Big*' and 'Tdf*' data.
- Introduced a custom Big format version using Snappy instead of
  DEFLATE for data block compression.
- Added 'BigFile#duplicate' and 'TdfFile#duplicate' for creating an
  independent view of the file data for parallel access.
- Fixed a bug in 'BedGraphTrack#span' which was always zero, see issue
  #25 on GitHub for details.
- B+ tree keys should be byte arrays and *not* NUL-terminated strings.
  See 'bPlusTree.c' in UCSC sources for complete spec.
- Changed 'BPlusTree#write' to use a smaller block size if a B+ tree
  fits in a single block.
- Changed 'BigWigFile.write' and 'BigBedFile.write' *not* to load all
  of the data in memory at once.

Version 0.2.5
-------------

Technical release, released on February 3rd 2016

- Migrated to Kotlin 1.0.0-rc.

Version 0.2.4
-------------

Technical release, released on February 1st 2016

Version 0.2.3
-------------

Released on December 10th 2015

- Cleaned up 'Tdf*' API and made it more consistent with the rest of
  the codebase.
- Serializing 'TdfFile' access is now a responsibility of the caller.
  See issue #22 on GitHub.

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on November 19th 2015

- Added initial support for TDF format, see 'TDFReader'. The API is
  unstable at the moment, it might change in future releases.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on November 2nd 2015

- Allowed creating empty 'BigWigFile' and 'BigBedFile'.

Version 0.2.0
--------------

Technical release, released on October 22th 2015

- Migrated to Kotlin 1.0.0-beta.
- Added reasonable defaults to 'BigFile#summarize'.

Version 0.1.9
-------------

Bugfix release, released on September 16th 2015

- Fixed a bug in 'WigSection#query', which threw if the callee was empty.
- Migrated to Kotlin M13.

Version 0.1.8
-------------

Released on September 11th 2015

- Added support for reading and writing BedGraph sections to 'BigWigFile'.

Version 0.1.7
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 24th 2015

- Fixed 'BigFile.Post.Zoom' which produced degenerate R+ trees with
  all leaves covering the same interval.
- Updated 'WigParser' to handle NaN and infinities.

Version 0.1.6
-------------

Released on August 24th 2015

- Fixed WIG section re-alignment in 'BigWigFile#queryInternal': queries
  for overlapping intervals were incorrectly shifted to the right.
- Changed 'BigFile.Post.Zoom' to start with initial reduction estimated
  from mean interval size in the data.
- Changed 'Big*.write' to accept chromosome names and sizes explicitly.

Version 0.1.5
-------------

Released on August 20th 2015

- Enabled buffering in 'SeekableDataOutput'.
- Fixed a bug in 'RTreeIndex.write' which sometimes produced invalid
  offsets for internal R+ tree nodes.
- 'BigWigFile#queryInternal' now correctly filters variable step sections
  in the case when a section overlaps the query interval.
- 'BigFile#query' now allows to query for items overlapping or completely
  contained within the query.
- Changed 'BigFile.Post.Zoom' to aggregate summaries into slots prior
  to building R+ tree index.

Version 0.1.4
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 17th 2015

- Added total summary block which is required for version>=4
- Changed 'Big*.write' to skip empty chromosomes when pre-computing
  zoom levels.
- Fixed interval alignment for partial 'BigWigFile' queries. In the
  case when WIG section was overlapping the query the section was
  truncated to the query start instead of the first section interval
  contained in the query. The bug did not affect variable step sections.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

Released on August 12th 2015

- Enabled data section compression by default for both BigWIG and BigBED.
- Extended the API to allow non-standard byte order to be used when
  creating BigWIG and BigBED files.
- Changed 'Big*.write' to pre-compute zoom levels. The current implementation
  is far from being optimal, but it is, however, easy to comprehend.
- Implemented summarisation for BigWIG files.
- Changed 'BigWigFile.write' to splice WIG sections larger than
  'Short.MAX_VALUE'.
- Fixed 'BigWigFile#query' which sometimes returned values outside
  of a given query interval.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 6th 2015

- Changed 'RTreeIndex' not to enforce the leaves to only contain items
  from a single chromosome.
- Fixed 'RTreeIndex.write' for the case of a few items to be indexed.
- Fixed 'FixedStepSection#query' for the case of overlapping intervals.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Released on July 29th 2015

- Added basic support for summarising BigBED data. The implementation
  is only capable of using pre-computed zoom levels, i.e. 'BigBedFile.write'
  does not build zoomed indices.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on July 24th 2015
