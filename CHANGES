big Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each big release.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

- Compression for the data section is now turned on by default.
- '.write' for both BigWIG and BigBED now pre-computes zoom levels. The
  implementation however is far from being optimal.
- BigWIG can be summarised the same way as BigBED.
- Changed 'BigWigFile.write' to splice WIG sections larger than
  'Short.MAX_VALUE'.
- Fixed 'BigWigFile#query' which sometimes returned values outside
  of a given query interval.
- It is now possible to create BigWIG and BigBED files using a non-native
  byte order.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 6th 2015

- Changed 'RTreeIndex' not to enforce the leaves to only contain items
  from a single chromosome.
- Fixed 'RTreeIndex.write' for the case of a few items to be indexed.
- Fixed 'FixedStepSection#query' for the case of overlapping intervals.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Released on July 29th 2015

- Added basic support for summarising BigBED data. The implementation
  is only capable of using pre-computed zoom levels, i.e. 'BigBedFile.write'
  does not build zoomed indices.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on July 24th 2015
