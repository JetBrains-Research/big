big Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each big release.

Version 0.1.5
-------------

- Enabled buffering in 'SeekableDataOutput'.
- Fixed a bug in 'RTreeIndex.write' which sometimes produced invalid
  offsets for internal R+ tree nodes.
- 'BigWig#query' now correctly filters variable step sections in the
  case when a section overlaps the query interval.


Version 0.1.4
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 17th 2015

- Added total summary block which is required for version>=4
- Changed 'Big*.write' to skip empty chromosomes when pre-computing
  zoom levels.
- Fixed interval alignment for partial 'BigWigFile' queries. In the
  case when WIG section was overlapping the query the section was
  truncated to the query start instead of the first section interval
  contained in the query. The bug did not affect variable step sections.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

Released on August 12th 2015

- Enabled data section compression by default for both BigWIG and BigBED.
- Extended the API to allow non-standard byte order to be used when
  creating BigWIG and BigBED files.
- Changed 'Big*.write' to pre-compute zoom levels. The current implementation
  is far from being optimal, but it is, however, easy to comprehend.
- Implemented summarisation for BigWIG files.
- Changed 'BigWigFile.write' to splice WIG sections larger than
  'Short.MAX_VALUE'.
- Fixed 'BigWigFile#query' which sometimes returned values outside
  of a given query interval.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on August 6th 2015

- Changed 'RTreeIndex' not to enforce the leaves to only contain items
  from a single chromosome.
- Fixed 'RTreeIndex.write' for the case of a few items to be indexed.
- Fixed 'FixedStepSection#query' for the case of overlapping intervals.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Released on July 29th 2015

- Added basic support for summarising BigBED data. The implementation
  is only capable of using pre-computed zoom levels, i.e. 'BigBedFile.write'
  does not build zoomed indices.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on July 24th 2015
